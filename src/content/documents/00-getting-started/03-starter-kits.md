title: Starter Kits
---

If you follow the instructions in [Creating an Application](../creating-an-application/), you will end up with a working application.
Those steps are designed so that you can see each piece working one at a time.
The starter kits provide a more complete developer experience.
But if something goes wrong, they might be harder to diagnose.

First, pick your language.
Then, pick your front-end framework.
Finally, export the repository.
If you have Subversion installed, you can do that in a single line.
Otherwise, you will need to download it via the GitHub repository page.
