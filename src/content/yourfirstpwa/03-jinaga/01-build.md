title: "Build"

To get started, clone and detach the Jinaga starter.
We'll use the one based on JavaScript and React.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinaga/starter-javascript-react.git jinagapwa
cd jinagapwa
rm -rf .git
npm install
```

Then build and run the application.

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The application starts at http://localhost:8080/.
You should see a link asking you to log in on Twitter.
For this part to work, you will need a Twitter API key.
