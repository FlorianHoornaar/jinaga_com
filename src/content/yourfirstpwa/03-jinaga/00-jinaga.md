So far we have cached content and application code so that the user has access while offline.
But what about their data?
We want to store the user's data while they are offline so that they can still see it when they open up the app.
And we also want to persist any changes that the user makes so that we can send it up when they reconnect.
Jinaga does all of this splendidly.
